These games come in different forms that can be grouped in two broad classes, namely of matching and allocation games, and they have a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from two-sided markets where buyers and sellers are encoded as vertices in a graph, to allocation problems where indivisible goods have to be assigned (matched) to agents in a fair way, possibly using monetary compensations. The Shapley value and the related notion of Banzhaf value have often been identified as appropriate solution concepts for many applications of matching/allocation games, but their computation is intractable in general. It is known that these concepts can be computed in polynomial time for matching games on unweighted trees and on graphs having degree at most two. However, it was open whether or not such positive results could be extended to the more general case of graphs having bounded treewidth, and to the case of allocation problems on weighted graphs. The paper provides a positive answer to these questions, by showing that computing the Shapley value and the Banzhaf value is feasible in polynomial time for the following classes of games: matching games over unweighted graphs having bounded treewidth, allocation games over weighted graphs having bounded treewidth, and allocation games over weighted graphs and such that each good is of interest for two agents at most.

The main result is that, over the class of allocation games, the Shapley value and the Banzhaf value can be computed in polynomial time when interactions among agents can be formalized as graphs of bounded treewidth. This is shown by means of technical tools that are of interest in their own and that can be used for analyzing different kinds of coalitional games. Tractability is also shown for games where each good can be assigned to at most two agents, independently of their interactions.","tags":["Game theory","Polynomial approximation","Bounded treewidth","Coalitional game","Fair divisions","Indivisible good","Polynomial-time","Solution concepts","Structural requirements","Technical tools","Artificial intelligence"],"type":"Conference paper","pubtype":1,"pdfPath":"/publication/2015/ijcai-international-joint-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-1/ijcai-international-joint-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-1.pdf","citePath":"/publication/2015/ijcai-international-joint-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-1/cite.bib","featured":false},{"id":"ceur-workshop-proceedings-1-2014","title":"Smart applications for smart city: A contribution to innovation","authors":"Citrigno, Simona, Graziano, Sabrina, Lupia, Francesco, Saccà, Domenico","venue":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","year":2014,"abstract":"Main research activities and results of the project TETRis-TETRA Innovative Open Source Services are described that are aimed at enabling innovative services for Smart City/Smart Territory by means of technological tools and intelligent platforms for collecting, representing, managing and exploiting data and information gathered from sensors and devices deployed in the territory.

An approach to accomplishing this task is presented, where the learning process can exploit background knowledge available to the analyst. The method is based on encoding the information gathered from the log and the (possibly) given background knowledge in terms of precedence constraints, i.e., constraints over the topology of the graphs. Learning algorithms are formulated in terms of reasoning problems over precedence constraints. The whole approach has been implemented in a prototype system and results of experimental activity are reported.","tags":["Data mining","Database systems","Back-ground knowledge","Causal dependencies","Experimental activities","High-level modeling","Learning process","Precedence constraints","Process activities","Reasoning problems","Topology"],"type":"Conference paper","pubtype":1,"pdfPath":"/publication/2013/21st-italian-symposium-on-advanced-database-systems-sebd-2013-1/21st-italian-symposium-on-advanced-database-systems-sebd-2013-1.pdf","citePath":"/publication/2013/21st-italian-symposium-on-advanced-database-systems-sebd-2013-1/cite.bib","featured":false}]
