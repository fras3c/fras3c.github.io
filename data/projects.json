    "description": "A framework for Cyber Ranges.",
    "about": "The goal of the ARTIC project is that of (1) designing a novel architecture for cyber ranges, following the input provided by industrial partners, which will establish standards for the main components' operations while reducing human and technological costs, (2) releasing a PoC framework that implements the aforementioned architecture and provides facilities to assess how new technological solutions, e.g., microservices, paradigms, e.g., digital twins, and methodologies based on domain-specific languages, reasoning systems, and formal methods can improve the design and execution phase of training and testing activities, (3) examining the requirements to extend the currently available scenarios to embed new cybersecurity domains, e.g., AI or 5G technologies, and (4) releasing a PoC of a multi-domain scenario also including such new technologies and providing the capabilities to execute testing and training activities.",
