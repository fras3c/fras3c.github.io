It consists of analyzing a set of traces registering the sequence of tasks performed along several enactments of a transactional system, in order to build a process model that can explain all the episodes recorded over them. An approach to accomplish this task is presented that can benefit from the background knowledge that, in many cases, is available to the analysts taking care of the process (re-)design. The approach is based on encoding the information gathered from the log and the (possibly) given background knowledge in terms of precedence constraints, that is, of constraints over the topology of the resulting process models. Mining algorithms are eventually formulated in terms of reasoning problems over precedence constraints, and the computational complexity of such problems is thoroughly analyzed by tracing their tractability frontier. Solution algorithms are proposed and their properties analyzed. These algorithms have been implemented in a prototype system, and results of a thorough experimental activity are discussed. © 2015 ACM.","Computational complexity; Graph analysis; Process mining","Computational complexity; Back-ground knowledge; Experimental activities; Graph analysis; Precedence constraints; Process mining; Reasoning problems; Solution algorithms; Transactional systems; Data mining","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930791285"

The main objective of applying CPs is that of optimizing both outcomes and efficiency — however, the actual implementation of CPs can be complex and result in important deviations and unexpected inefficiencies. In this paper, we develop an approach to identifying and understanding such problems by leveraging process mining techniques and background knowledge. We design specific data structures aimed at properly capturing the data produced during the implementation of CPs, including the treatment of more than one disease for a single patient. We then provide a methodology to discover and characterize congestion dynamics in CPs.

When goods are indivisible, it is possible to use money compensation to perform a fair allocation taking into account the actual contribution of all agents to the social welfare. Coalitional games provide a formal mathematical framework to model such problems, in particular the Shapley value is a solution concept widely used for assigning worths to agents in a fair way. Unfortunately, computing this value is a #P-hard problem, so that applying this good theoretical notion is often quite difficult in real-world problems. In this paper, we first review the application of the Shapley value to an allocation problem that models the evaluation of the Italian research structures with a procedure known as VQR. For large universities, the problem involves thousands of agents and goods (here, researchers and their research products). We then describe some useful properties that allow us to greatly simplify many such large instances. Moreover, we propose new algorithms for computing lower bounds and upper bounds of the Shapley value, which in some cases provide the exact result and that can be combined with approximation algorithms. The proposed techniques have been tested on large real-world instances of the VQR research evaluation problem.","","Application programs; Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial mathematics; Game theory; Allocation problems; Assessment programs; Mathematical frameworks; Real-world problem; Research evaluation; Research structure; Solution concepts; Useful properties; Problem solving","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006253442"

The prototypical solution concepts for them are the Shapley value and the Banzhaf value. Unfortunately, their computation is intractable, formally #P-hard. Motivated by this bad news, structural requirements are investigated which can be used to identify islands of tractability. The main result is that, over the class of allocation games, the Shapley value and the Banzhaf value can be computed in polynomial time when interactions among agents can be formalized as graphs of bounded treewidth. This is shown by means of technical tools that are of interest in their own and that can be used for analyzing different kinds of coalitional games. Tractability is also shown for games where each good can be assigned to at most two agents, independently of their interactions.","","Game theory; Polynomial approximation; Bounded treewidth; Coalitional game; Fair divisions; Indivisible good; Polynomial-time; Solution concepts; Structural requirements; Technical tools; Artificial intelligence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949782661"

Most structural decomposition methods can be characterized through hypergraph games that are variations of the Robber and Cops graph game that characterizes the notion of treewidth. In particular, decomposition trees somehow correspond to monotone winning strategies, where the escape space of the robber on the hypergraph is shrunk monotonically by the cops. The paper overviews some recent results (to appear on the Information and Computation journal) about a general way to exploit the greater power of non-monotonic strategies, by allowing a ""disciplined"" form of non-monotonicity, characteristic of cops playing in a greedy way. It is shown that deciding the existence of a (non-monotone) greedy winning strategy (and compute one, if any) is tractable. Moreover, despite their non-monotonicity, such strategies always induce valid decomposition trees, which can be computed efficiently based on them. As a consequence, greedy strategies allow us to define new islands of tractability for the considered problems properly including all previously known classes of tractable instances. © 2016, Sistemi Evoluti per Basi di Dati (SEBD).

These exercises have the goal of guiding merit-based public funds allocation, stimulating improvement of research productivity through competition and assessing the impact of adopted research support policies. One case in point is Italy's most recent research assessment effort, VQR 2011-2014 (Research Quality Evaluation), which, in addition to research institutions, also evaluated university departments, and individuals in some cases (i.e., recently hired research staff and members of PhD committees). However, the way an institution's score was divided, according to VQR rules, between its constituent departments or its staff members does not enjoy many desirable properties well known from coalitional game theory (e.g., budget balance, fairness, marginality). We propose, instead, an alternative score division rule that is based on the notion of Shapley value, a well known solution concept in coalitional game theory, which enjoys the desirable properties mentioned above. For a significant test case (namely, Sapienza University of Rome, the largest university in Italy), we present a detailed comparison of the scores obtained, for substructures and individuals, by applying the official VQR rules, with those resulting from Shapley value computations. We show that there are significant differences in the resulting scores, making room for improvements in the allocation rules used in research assessment exercises. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.","Bibliometrics; Research assessment; Research productivity; Shapley value","Budget control; Productivity; Quality control; Bibliometrics; Coalitional game theory; Recent researches; Research assessment exercise; Research institutions; Research productivity; Shapley value; University of Rome; Game theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058031245"

The question in these cases is how to divide in a fair way the outcome that the network eventually earns, say money, to the participating agents. The paper faces this issue by focusing on a real-world application: the distribution of funds to Italian research structures and substructures, after a research assessment program (known as VQR) that is currently evaluating the Italian research production over years 2011-2014. In fact, we report our recent results in [1], for allocation problems that find application to the VQR. In particular, we describe a number of desirable properties for any reasonable fair division rule, we identify a division rule satisfying all such properties, as well as algorithms for its computation. The proposed solution is based on the gametheoretic notion of Shapley value, and the algorithms for its computation exploit recent advances in the problem of counting solutions to conjunctive queries. © 2016, Sistemi Evoluti per Basi di Dati (SEBD).

Indeed, several results are known about the complexity of computing over them solution concepts. In particular, it is known that computing the Shapley value is intractable in general, formally #P-hard, and feasible in polynomial time over games defined on trees. In fact, it was an open problem whether or not this tractability result holds over classes of graphs properly including acyclic ones. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a positive answer to this question, by showing that the Shapley value is tractable for matching games defined over graphs having bounded treewidth. The proposed polynomial-time algorithm has been implemented and tested on classes of graphs having different sizes and treewidth up to three.","","Artificial intelligence; Game theory; Polynomial approximation; Bounded treewidth; Coalitional game; Different sizes; Matching game; Polynomial-time; Polynomial-time algorithms; Shapley value; Solution concepts; Computer games","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031914457"

These games come in different forms that can be grouped in two broad classes, namely of matching and allocation games, and they have a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from two-sided markets where buyers and sellers are encoded as vertices in a graph, to allocation problems where indivisible goods have to be assigned (matched) to agents in a fair way, possibly using monetary compensations. The Shapley value and the related notion of Banzhaf value have often been identified as appropriate solution concepts for many applications of matching/allocation games, but their computation is intractable in general. It is known that these concepts can be computed in polynomial time for matching games on unweighted trees and on graphs having degree at most two. However, it was open whether or not such positive results could be extended to the more general case of graphs having bounded treewidth, and to the case of allocation problems on weighted graphs. The paper provides a positive answer to these questions, by showing that computing the Shapley value and the Banzhaf value is feasible in polynomial time for the following classes of games: matching games over unweighted graphs having bounded treewidth, allocation games over weighted graphs having bounded treewidth, and allocation games over weighted graphs and such that each good is of interest for two agents at most. Without such structural restrictions, computing these solution concepts on allocation games is instead shown to be #P-hard, even in the case of unweighted graphs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coalitional games; Computational complexity; Matching theory; Monadic second order logic; Shapley value; Tree decompositions","Computational complexity; Computer games; Graphic methods; Polynomial approximation; Trees (mathematics); Coalitional game; Matching theory; Monadic second-order logic; Shapley value; Tree decomposition; Game theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073689886"
