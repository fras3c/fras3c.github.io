abstract: "Accurately determining the number of people affected by emergencies is essential for deploying effective response measures during disasters. Traditional solutions like cellular and Wi-Fi networks are often rendered ineffective during such emergencies due to widespread infrastructure damage or non-functional connectivity, prompting the exploration of more resilient methods. This paper proposes a novel solution utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology and decentralized networks composed entirely of mobile and wearable devices to count individuals autonomously without reliance on external communication equipment or specialized personnel. This count leverages uncoordinated relayed communication among devices within these networks, enabling us to extend our counting capabilities well beyond the direct range of rescuers. A formally evaluated, experimentally validated, and privacy-preserving counting algorithm that demonstrates rapid convergence and high accuracy even in large-scale scenarios is employed. © 2024 The Authors"
