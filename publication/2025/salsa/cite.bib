abstract = {In an era where industrial Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are paramount to enabling cybersecurity, they can unintentionally become enablers of intellectual property theft through the data they analyze and retain. The above issue requires finding solutions to strike a balance between data protection and security. This paper proposes a real-time data anonymization framework designed to operate directly within network devices. Using an extensive case study, our approach demonstrates how valuable intellectual property associated with industrial processes can be protected without compromising the effectiveness of behavioral anomaly detection systems. The methodology is designed to be nonintrusive, reversible, and seamlessly portable on existing security solutions. We evaluated these properties through comprehensive experimental testing, which showed both the method's effectiveness in securing intellectual property and its suitability for continuous real-time operation.}
