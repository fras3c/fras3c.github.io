abstract: "Main research activities and results of the project TETRis-TETRA Innovative Open Source Services are described that are aimed at enabling innovative services for Smart City/Smart Territory by means of technological tools and intelligent platforms for collecting, representing, managing and exploiting data and information gathered from sensors and devices deployed in the territory. Technological tools and intelligent platforms are integrated into two smart environments for monitoring of respectively mobility and environmental resources and for providing advanced services to citizens as well as to urban operators. The general architecture and goals of the two smart environments are illustrated and some insights on the prototype for the mobility monitoring environment are reported."
