abstract: "In order to reduce the cost of healthcare processes, optimization systems are used to optimize logistics in healthcare. Algorithms for solving the so-called Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) are more and more applied in healthcare systems requiring the movement of nursery/medical staff or patients. In this paper, we introduce a novel software platform that uses a cooperative vehicle routing algorithm and is able to reduce transportation costs in healthcare applications requiring the movement of nursery/medical staff. The COOP-VR platform adapts an already existing VRP algorithm to the healthcare context and allows the cooperation between two independent healthcare organizations (shippers) that manage their own vehicle fleets in a given geographic area. Preliminary simulation results show the possibility to reduce costs for both healthcare organizations in a range between 1% and 21% of the initial transportation costs. © 2018 ACM."
