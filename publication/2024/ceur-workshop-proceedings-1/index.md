abstract: "The evolution of technology in the maritime sector has markedly enhanced both operational efficiency and safety by incorporating Industrial Control Systems. Nonetheless, such advancements have concurrently unveiled cybersecurity vulnerabilities, introducing novel risks to maritime operations. In this paper, we explore the standard architecture of integrated maritime systems, with a specific emphasis on the Steering Gear subsystem, and present an adversary model tailored for the technological and operational context of the maritime sector. We introduce a methodology embedded in a custom malware that employs a process mining method, aimed at conducting physics-aware, targeted attacks. The results show that such a malware can delivery attacks that have disruptive consequences on the ships. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
