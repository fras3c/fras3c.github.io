abstract: "Industrial control systems (ICSs) are vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks, i.e., security breaches in cyberspace that adversely affect the underlying physical processes. In this context, honeypots are effective countermeasures both to defend against such attacks and discover new attack strategies. In recent years, honeypots for ICSs have made significant progress in faithfully emulating OT networks, including physical process interactions. We propose HoneyICS, a high-interaction, physics-aware, scalable, and extensible honeynet for ICSs, equipped with an advanced monitoring system. We deployed our honeynet on the Internet and conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of HoneyICS. © 2023 ACM."
