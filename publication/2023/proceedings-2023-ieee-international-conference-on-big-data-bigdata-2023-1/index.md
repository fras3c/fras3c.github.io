abstract: "The recent proliferation of sophisticated threats targeting the plant of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) has triggered a growing interest in the development of dedicated honeypots/honeynets in which the emulation of Operational Technology (OT) components plays a major role. This work presents a latitudinal study on a dataset comprising both IT and ICS interactions collected from an instance of an ICS honeynet emulating ICS devices exposed on the Internet for three months. The study focuses on three orthogonal aspects of such interactions: level of interaction, origin of interactions, and interaction/attack patterns. Our results shed light on the impact of different choices in the configuration of a honeynet on its attractiveness and on the captured behavior.  © 2023 IEEE."
