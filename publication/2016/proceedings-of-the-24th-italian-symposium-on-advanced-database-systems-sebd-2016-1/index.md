abstract: "Structural decomposition methods have been developed for identifying tractable classes of instances of fundamental problems in databases, such as conjunctive queries and query containment. Most structural decomposition methods can be characterized through hypergraph games that are variations of the Robber and Cops graph game that characterizes the notion of treewidth. In particular, decomposition trees somehow correspond to monotone winning strategies, where the escape space of the robber on the hypergraph is shrunk monotonically by the cops. The paper overviews some recent results (to appear on the Information and Computation journal) about a general way to exploit the greater power of non-monotonic strategies, by allowing a \"disciplined\" form of non-monotonicity, characteristic of cops playing in a greedy way. It is shown that deciding the existence of a (non-monotone) greedy winning strategy (and compute one, if any) is tractable. Moreover, despite their non-monotonicity, such strategies always induce valid decomposition trees, which can be computed efficiently based on them. As a consequence, greedy strategies allow us to define new islands of tractability for the considered problems properly including all previously known classes of tractable instances. © 2016, Sistemi Evoluti per Basi di Dati (SEBD).
